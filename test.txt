In 2014, the mid-sized city of Langenfurt faced a mounting crisis in its public transportation system. Passenger numbers on buses and trams had been steadily declining for nearly a decade, while congestion and private car ownership were increasing. City officials initially assumed that residents were simply becoming wealthier and preferred the comfort of private vehicles. This explanation seemed plausible, because average household income had indeed risen by 18 percent between 2005 and 2013, and car registrations had gone up by 22 percent in the same period. However, a closer look at the data suggested that this was only part of the story.

A policy analyst in the city’s Department of Urban Mobility, Dr. Helena Krauss, noticed an interesting pattern when she overlaid transit usage data with information on service changes. The steepest drops in ridership did not occur uniformly over time: they were clustered around specific years in which the city had changed routes, reduced evening services, or modified ticketing rules. In 2008, for example, the city replaced a direct tram line between the eastern residential district of Hohenfeld and the central train station with a bus line that required a transfer downtown. Officially, this change was justified on the grounds of “operational efficiency” and the need to cut costs. Yet within twelve months, daily ridership on that corridor had fallen by 37 percent, even though population in Hohenfeld continued to grow.

When Dr. Krauss commissioned a survey of Hohenfeld residents in 2010, the responses challenged the administration’s earlier assumptions. Only a minority of respondents cited increased income or car ownership as their primary reason for abandoning public transport. Instead, the most common complaints were longer and less predictable travel times, the inconvenience of transfers—especially for parents with strollers and elderly passengers—and a perception that buses were less reliable in winter weather than trams. Several respondents also mentioned that the new bus route’s timetable had been adjusted so that the last vehicle toward Hohenfeld left the city center before the end of most theater performances and evening classes.

These findings prompted Dr. Krauss to broaden her analysis beyond that single corridor. She compiled a timeline of changes to the entire network: reductions in late‑evening and early‑morning services, the removal of some low‑ridership stops, the introduction of a new zonal fare system that made certain cross‑town trips more expensive, and a rebranding campaign that emphasized “efficiency” and “modernization” but did not involve tangible improvements from the rider’s perspective. When she mapped these changes against ridership statistics, she discovered that declines were strongly correlated with moments when the system became more complex or less convenient for specific groups, such as shift workers, students, and residents of outlying districts.

One particularly revealing case was the 2011 change to night‑time services. To cut operating costs, the city replaced several overlapping night bus routes with a single circular line that ran less frequently but theoretically covered more neighborhoods. On paper, coverage improved: more stops were technically within walking distance of more households. In practice, the average door‑to‑door travel time for night‑shift workers at the industrial park increased by 25 to 40 minutes, because they now had to ride the circular line almost halfway around the city before reaching their stop. Notably, many of these workers did not own cars and had previously relied on the direct night buses. Within a year, the proportion of industrial park employees commuting by public transport dropped from 48 percent to 29 percent, while bicycle commuting and informal car‑pooling increased.

Dr. Krauss’s report argued that the city had fallen into what she called the “efficiency trap”: a pattern in which short‑term cost‑cutting measures, justified by the language of optimization, led to long‑term losses in ridership and public trust. By focusing narrowly on metrics like cost per vehicle‑kilometer and average occupancy per vehicle, Langenfurt’s decision‑makers had overlooked less easily quantifiable factors such as perceived reliability, simplicity of routes, and the emotional comfort of not having to worry about missed connections late at night. She emphasized that once riders abandon public transport and adapt their lives around car use or alternative arrangements, it becomes far harder—and more expensive—to win them back.

In response to the report, the city council was split. Some members accepted the findings and pushed for a “convenience‑first” strategy that would restore some direct routes, extend evening and night services on key corridors, and introduce an integrated ticket that allowed unlimited transfers within 60 minutes at no extra cost. Others argued that the city’s budget could not support such measures without either significant tax increases or cuts to other services. A particularly contentious debate erupted around the idea of reinstating the direct tram line between Hohenfeld and the central station. Critics pointed out that the tram infrastructure had been partially dismantled and that rebuilding it would require a large upfront investment, while supporters claimed that the corridor’s high population density and strong latent demand justified a long‑term commitment.

To test the potential impact of more rider‑centric changes without immediately making irreversible investments, Dr. Krauss proposed a one‑year “mobility experiment.” Instead of rebuilding tracks, the city would run an express bus between Hohenfeld and the central station during peak hours, with no intermediate stops and guaranteed timed connections to regional trains. At the same time, the transit agency would simplify the fare structure by eliminating one confusing tariff zone that cut across the eastern districts, and it would extend the operating hours of several lines by 45 minutes into the late evening. Digital displays showing real‑time arrival information would be installed at the busiest stops in Hohenfeld and near the industrial park.

The results of this experiment, evaluated after twelve months, were mixed but instructive. Overall system‑wide ridership increased by 6 percent, reversing the previous downward trend. On the Hohenfeld–central station corridor, ridership grew by 24 percent compared to the period before the express bus was introduced, although it still did not reach the peak levels recorded when the tram line had been in operation. Surveys indicated that passengers appreciated the faster and more predictable trips, as well as the clearer fare rules. However, some residents in neighborhoods that did not directly benefit from the experiment perceived the changes as unfair, arguing that the city was privileging specific districts while leaving others with reduced or stagnant service. This political backlash highlighted a recurring tension in public transport planning: targeted improvements can generate measurable gains but may also produce a sense of inequality if not accompanied by a broader, clearly communicated long‑term vision.

By the time the experiment concluded, Langenfurt’s leaders were forced to confront an uncomfortable conclusion. The decline in transit use could not be adequately explained by rising incomes or cultural preferences for cars alone. It was, to a significant extent, a consequence of the city’s own policy decisions over many years—decisions that had treated riders as abstract units in a spreadsheet rather than as people with specific schedules, vulnerabilities, and expectations. A sustainable reversal of the trend would require more than isolated experiments. It would demand a coherent strategy that balanced financial constraints with a renewed commitment to convenience, reliability, and perceived fairness across the entire network.
