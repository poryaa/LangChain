       "'In response to the report, the city council was split. Some members accepted the findings and pushed for a “convenience‑first” strategy that would restore some direct routes, extend evening and night services on key corridors, and introduce an integrated ticket that allowed unlimited transfers within 60 minutes at no extra cost. Others argued that the city’s budget could not support such measures without either significant tax increases or cuts to other services. A particularly contentious debate erupted around the idea of reinstating the direct tram line between Hohenfeld and the central station. Critics pointed out that the tram infrastructure had been partially dismantled and that rebuilding it would require a large upfront investment, while supporters claimed that the corridor’s high population density and strong latent demand justified a long‑term commitment.'"
